To Do Tonight:
- OT Library Data
	- GridSearchCV best Lasso
		- save features and coefficients into dataframe/csv
	- Lasso feature selection
		- save several sets of features to dict
	- GridSearchCV best NN
		- save features and metrics into dataframe/csv

To Do Tomorrow:
- OT Library Data
	- Visualize feature optimization
		- line graph of model error as # features increase
		- use GBRT, LR, NN
	- Talk to Matt about other ways to visualize
- On-target Library Data
	- Visualize feature optimization
- Both
	- compare feature optimization, hightlighting things that jump out
	- compare model error
